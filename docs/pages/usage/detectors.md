# Detectors

*Detectors* are programs that analyze executable samples. They aim to detect packing traces or algorithms.

## Tool

A [dedicated tool](https://github.com/dhondta/docker-packing-box/blob/main/files/tools/detector) called `detector` is provided with the [*Packing Box*](https://github.com/dhondta/docker-packing-box) to detect packers. Its help message tells everything the user needs to get started.

```session
# detector --help
[...]
This tool aims to manipulate a dataset in multiple ways by:
- adding new executables from the packing-box Docker image or from a user-defined source, packed or not with the
   selected packers installed in the image.
[...]
    convert             convert the target dataset to a fileless one
