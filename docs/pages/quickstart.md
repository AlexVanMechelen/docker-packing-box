# Quick Start

## Getting started

The box can be built with the following command (note that it takes a while as it installs many underlying packages) :

```console
# docker build -t packing-box .
```

When [running the Docker image](index.md#run) ;

```console
# docker run -it -h packing-box -v `pwd`:/mnt/share packing-box
```

We are presented with a root shell that starts with a help message like this:

## Getting Help

Help can be obtained by using the "`?`" tool. This will display the welcome message seen when starting it. It has an option `-i ITEM` / `--item ITEM` allowing to see the specific help of an item from the box.

The help tool has also a `-k {detectors|packers|unpackers}` / `--keep {detectors|packers|unpackers}` option to only display specific classes of items. The same applies to formats with the `-f FORMAT` / `--format FORMAT` option. For instance, if we want to display packers for the Portable Executable (PE) format, we can type:

## Items management

From the help message, the section named *Tools* shows the list of available tools. The main one is `packing-box`. It is aimed to install and test items but also to display or edit the workspace or even to configure options like the workspace's folder.

```console
$ packing-box --help

The tool's help message provides a few interesting examples of possible actions.

## Playing with datasets

A dedicated tool called `dataset` allows to manipulate datasets.

The following simple example creates a dataset called "`test-pe-upx`" consisting of 100 PE files (including 32-bits and 64-bits) from the source folders of Wine integrated in the box, balanced between not-packed and UPX-packed samples.

```console
$ dataset make test-pe-upx -n 100 --format PE --packer upx
```

The following command lets us see some details of the newly created dataset (including some metadata and its statistics per size ranges for not-packed and packed samples):

```console
$ dataset show test-pe-upx
```

Up to now, we have built a dataset that contains the samples. The next command will convert it to a fileless dataset, that is with the features computed. This has the advantages of precomputing the features and thus speeding up further processings like model training and drastically reducing the size of the dataset (especially useful when planning to exchange it with other researchers). But it has the disadvantage to remove the files, therefore making the dataset unusable with integrated detectors or even preventing from feature modifications.

```console
$ dataset convert test-pe-upx
```

## Playing with models

A dedicated tool called `model` allows to manipulate models.

The following simple example trains a Random Forest on a reference dataset called "`test-pe-upx`".

```console
$ model train test-pe-upx -a rf
```

Once trained, the model receives an auto-generated name that includes the name of the reference dataset, the executable formats it applies to, the number of samples from the reference dataset, the training algorithm and the number of considered features. In order to find back this name, the list command can be used to display all the existing models:

```console
$ model list
```

Let us assume that the newly trained model was named `test-pe-upx_pe32-pe64_100_rf_f111`, we can show its details (including metadata) by using the following command:

```console
$ model show test-pe-upx_pe32-pe64_100_rf_f111
```

If we want to test it against whatever dataset we want, we can use the following command (here, we test on the reference dataset itself):

```console
$ model test test-pe-upx_pe32-pe64_100_rf_f111 test-pe-upx
```
