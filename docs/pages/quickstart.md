When running the [Docker image](index.html#run), we are presented with a root shell that starts with a help message like this:

## Getting Help

Help can be obtained by using the "`?`" tool. This will display the welcome message seen when starting it. It also has an option `-i ITEM` allowing to see the particular help of an item from the box
