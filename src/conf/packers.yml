Amber:
  categories:
    - PE
  description: Amber is a position-independent(reflective) PE loader that enables in-memory execution of native PE files(EXE, DLL, SYS...). It enables stealthy in-memory payload deployment that can be used to bypass anti-virus, firewall, IDS, IPS products, and application white-listing mitigations. Reflective payloads generated by Amber can either be staged from a remote server or executed directly in memory much like a generic shellcode. By default, every generated payload is encoded using the new generation SGN encoder. Amber uses CRC32_API and IAT_API for inconspicuously resolving the Windows API function addresses. After the PE file is loaded and executed in memory, the reflective payload is erased for evading memory scanners.

It can pack executable files of Windows PE format files with almost the best compression ratio. Whereas DOS-EXEs(MZ), Win3.x-EXE/DLLs(NE), and any other platform programs are not supported by Upack. Upack is only for compression, not for protection mainly.
